# Open Solar E-Car
## Free Green Transportation Design for Everyone

The aim is to create free blueprint+instructions for building a simple, **attractive-looking**, and of course **legal**, two-passenger **solar car**, with **100% green charging** and transportation abilities.

The blueprints and instructions will enable any **non-technical person** to build the car at home with a screwdriver, saw and drill (and his/her own materials), for **under 1000$**. 

We believe that a green solar car can make our world a better place, providing better mobility for both developed and developing countries, and directly **affect the environment and economy**.

## Master Aims:
- Legal . Most of the current designs aren't legal in most countries. 
- Affordable price (under 1,000$)
- DIY : Can be built with only a screwdriver and drill using commodity parts.
- Safe.
- Good looking 
- Zero maintenance costs ; 100% powered by solar power.
- Long distance ( 2-3 hours of driving after 1 day of solar charging )
